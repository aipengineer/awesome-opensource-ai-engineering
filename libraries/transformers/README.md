# Transformers
![The AI Engineer presents Transformers](transformers_1920x192.png)
## Overview
Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models for text, vision, and audio tasks. Easily download models like BERT and GPT-2 or finetune them on your own data.

## Description
Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers provides an extensive model library and easy-to-use APIs for leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and speech models.

### 💡 Transformers Key Highlights
🔎 Thousands of Pretrained Models
Access a vast model zoo containing over 10,000 pretrained models for text, image, audio and multimodal tasks.

💬 NLP Models
Choose from popular models like BERT, GPT-2, T5 and BART for text tasks such as:
- Text classification
- Question answering
- Summarization
- Translation
- Text generation

🖼️ Computer Vision Models
Select vision models like ViT, DETR and CLIP for:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation

🎧 Audio Models 
Use audio models like Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Whisper for:
- Speech recognition
- Audio classification
- Speech translation

🤝 Simple APIs
Easily download and integrate models into projects with just a line of code

✏️ Easy Fine-tuning
Customize models for your own data and use cases by adding dataset-specific patterns. Saves work compared to training custom models.

🧑‍🔧 Flexible Frameworks
Use models across TensorFlow, PyTorch and JAX so you can optimize for training, evaluation and production.

🔌 Active Community
Benefit from an open source community building exciting projects with Transformers and sharing model contributions.

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about Transformers?

1. 💡 Extensive library of thousands of pretrained models for a vast array of natural language processing, computer vision, speech and audio tasks. Engineers can leverage this huge catalogue of existing models instead of building their own from scratch.

2. 🤝 Easy to use APIs let you download popular models like BERT, GPT-2, and ViT with just a single line of code. You can quickly integrate state-of-the-art models into your projects and products without needing to train them yourself.

3. 🧑‍💻 Easy fine-tuning allows you to customize models on your own datasets so the models learn specific patterns and information relevant to your use case. Saves resources compared to building custom models.

4. 🌟 Vibrant open source community constantly shares new model contributions and exciting projects built using transformers. Great way to get model ideas, project inspiration, and technical support.

5. 🛠️ Unified interface works across TensorFlow, PyTorch, & JAX so you can seamlessly switch between frameworks without rewriting entire model codebases. Flexibility allows using the right framework.
