## Overview
Continue lets you leverage LLMs like GPT-4 in VSCode/JetBrains as an autopilot, helping complete tasks through natural instructions and slash commands while reviewing all edits before accepting.

## Description
Continue 🚀 extends your IDE (VS Code, JetBrains) with LLM autopilot features to accelerate development. It lets you leverage models like GPT-4, Codex, and PaLM through natural language instructions and slash commands (/edit, /search, etc).

### 💡 Continue Key Highlights

🔁 Non-destructive - Review and accept/reject all edits before they touch your codebase

🤝 Collaborative - Chat with the LLM by highlighting code, asking questions, and giving step-by-step instructions

⚙️ Customizable - Bring your models or use built-in integration with GPT-3, Codex, Claude, and more

📑 Contextual - Reference diffs, open files, terminals, etc, to keep the LLM in the loop during tasks

🧮 Smart - Advanced prompting techniques make models 3-4x more accurate on code tasks

🔌 Extensible - Plugin architecture makes it easy to add new models, features, and slash commands

Instead of constantly context-switching to leverage these models, Continue makes them a natural part of your workflow - helping you stay in the flow while coding. The goal is to create an AI copilot that makes you happier and more productive.

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about Continue?

🚀 Accelerate development - Continue helps you complete coding tasks faster by providing an LLM autopilot in your editor

🧠 Reduce context switching - Keep your train of thought while coding instead of constantly switching to ChatGPT or other services

🔧 Increase customizability - Easily configure prompts, models, and slash commands tailored to your needs

👥 Improve collaboration - Chat with the LLM by referencing files/diffs to solve problems together

✅ Enhance transparency - Review all edits before executing so you stay in control of your codebase
