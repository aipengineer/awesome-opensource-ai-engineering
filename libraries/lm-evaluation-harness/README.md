![The AI Engineer presents lm-evaluation-harness](lm-evaluation-harness_1920x192.png)
## Overview
The lm-evaluation-harness from EleutherAI offers a unified framework for testing autoregressive language models over hundreds of NLP benchmark tasks through a consistent Python interface or command line tool.

## Description
The lm-evaluation-harness 🔧, developed by EleutherAI, provides a standardized way for researchers to robustly evaluate autoregressive language models ⚙️ (LLMs) on a wide range of natural language tasks 🗣. As LLMs grow in size and capabilities, rigorously auditing their strengths and weaknesses has become challenging yet increasingly crucial.

This open-source library tackles these problems by supplying a unified interface for testing LLMs on over 200 NLP benchmarks 📊, spanning areas like question answering, common sense reasoning, summarization, translation, and more. Researchers can evaluate models hosted locally or on APIs using the same codebase and inputs.

Whether you've built an LLM and want to benchmark it or are looking to reproduce results from a paper, the lm-evaluation-harness simplifies the process. Features like automatic batch size detection, model result caching 💾, and built-in parallelization make it easy to use. The library also enables customizable prompting and implements dataset decontamination 🔬 to limit train/test data leakage.

With over 100 citations in the last year, the lm-evaluation-harness has become a crucial tool for rigorously measuring and comparing progress in language models. Contributors welcome!

So, if you're working with LLMs, lm-evaluation-harness provides a standardized way to audit these models as they continue to grow ever more powerful.
