[![The AI Engineer presents Flowise AI](flowiseai_1920x192.png)]
## Overview
[FlowiseAI (YC S23)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flowiseai/) is an open-source drag-and-drop tool that allows anyone to build customized large language models (LLM) visual flows and backends for question-answering applications, summarization, and analysis.

With the rapid advancement of models like ChatGPT, LLMs are revolutionizing every industry. But how can less technical people utilize them for their own use cases? Flowise provides a LEGO-like interface to connect components like PDF loaders, OpenAI Embeddings, and vector databases to create customized ChatGPT tailored to your documents and data. You learn as you visually build!

### Key benefits

- 1️⃣  Open source with an MIT license, so it's free for commercial and personal use
- 2️⃣  Build backends and flows faster by seeing them execute live as you connect components
- 3️⃣  Highly extensible to integrate custom components using libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace, etc.
- 4️⃣  Drag-and-drop chat flows to interact with flows in real time
- 5️⃣  Expose flows as APIs or embed them into applications
- 6️⃣  Create tools that automate workflows, like fetching stock prices and adding to Airtable

If you're looking to leverage large language models like ChatGPT for your own use cases, Flowise's visual programming approach makes doing so incredibly intuitive. Get started in minutes by installing with NPM or spinning up a Docker container. Join the open-source community pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs for all!

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about Flowise AI?

1. 🤝 Accessibility - Low-code workflow visually empowers less technical users to build customized LLM solutions.
2. 🧩 Modularity - Lego-like prebuilt blocks enable combining capabilities, models, data etc into reuseable flows.
3. ⚡️ Speed - Interactive flow builder accelerates constructing functioning LLM backends 3-5x faster.
4. 👥 Community - Open source ecosystem fosters collaboration and contribution around LLM democratization.
5. 🔬 Education - Visual programming paradigm intuitively builds mental models of how LLM systems work.

In summary, Flowise accelerates innovation and collaboration around large language models by making it simpler to build customized solutions. Its visual approach also makes LLMs more accessible to domain experts beyond just AI engineers.
