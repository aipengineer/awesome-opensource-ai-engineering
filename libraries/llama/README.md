## Overview
Llama 2 is Meta's open-source language model, now with 2T training tokens and up to 70B parameters. Includes pre-trained & helpfulness/safety fine-tuned versions to enable language capabilities across research & commercial use cases.
## Description

As one of the largest open-source language models out there, Llama 2 represents scale and performance. With up to 70 billion parameters trained on 2 trillion tokens - far surpassing the original Llama release - it demonstrates the power of open-source language models. 📈

🔬 As an open-source model, engineers can freely experiment to push boundaries in areas like multi-task learning, prompt programming, reinforcement learning, and beyond.

🛠️ Llama 2 provides both a 2T parameter pre-trained base model and 1M+ parameter helpfulness/safety fine-tuned versions in Llama Chat and Code Llama. It gives engineers an excellent starting point for customizing to their own use cases.

Whether through prompt programming techniques, adapter layers, decoder-only training, or full fine-tuning, the mix of model scales and specializations makes Llama 2 a versatile foundation for real-world applications. 👷‍♀️
