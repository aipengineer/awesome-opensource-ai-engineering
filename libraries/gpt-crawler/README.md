## Overview
gpt-crawler crawls websites to generate knowledge files for creating custom GPT models tailored to your data.

## Description

With GPT Crawler, we can leverage web data to build custom AI assistants.

Often, as AI developers, we want to create specialized AI models tailored to our business data and documents. However, training customized natural language models from scratch is time-consuming and resource-intensive.

GPT Crawler offers another approach - it crawls websites to generate filtered knowledge files automatically that can be used to build custom GPT assistants.

We can create AI assistants around specific sites and topics rather than general domain training on broad corpora, with gpt-crawler—customization with just a URL.
