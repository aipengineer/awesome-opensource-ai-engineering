![The AI Engineer presents gpt-engineer](gpt-engineer_1920x192.png)
## Overview
GPT-Engineer leverages GPT-4 to automate software tasks through natural language instructions. Modular design allows you to clarify, generate code/specs, execute scripts, and more. 

## Description
GPT-Engineer is an open-source automation framework that leverages the power of models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to streamline software development workflows.

With GPT-Engineer, developers can describe software requirements and specifications using plain English. The framework then translates those written descriptions into working code and applications automatically. It eliminates the need to manually code solutions or deal with syntax and other code-level complexity.

### 💡 GPT-Engineer Key Highlights
